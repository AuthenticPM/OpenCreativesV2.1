**Tell us a brief bit about yourself and how you fell into your career path**

I grew up in Adelaide and as nice as it was had realised that it didn’t offer the lifestyle that other cities in Australia did.  I assumed I’d end up in sales when I fist started my real estate career but quickly found my niche in the Property Management side of the business. 

 **What did you wish you knew before you started your venture?** 

That like most careers they’re really nothing like what you expect them to be from the outside.  It’s not a bad thing just more a culture shock and means you learn things you never expected to.

**What are the most important failures you’ve had along the way?**

We aren’t always taught the best way to do things so I had to learn a few hard lessons that I’ll never repeat.  I can’t say I’d change anything because I don’t make mistakes anymore but unfortunately in my first few years there were quite a few!

**What drives you to keep pushing forward?**

The satisfaction I get from my clients.  There’s a saying along the lines of people only ever spreading bad stories but I’ve been fortunate that for me it’s the complete opposite.

**What’s the most shocking thing you’ve learned while creating APM?**

That it takes a lot more time than expected, and I really can’t emphasise enough how many hours it all takes.

**What difficulties did you have to overcome early on?** 

Exposure mainly, people not knowing who we are or trusting what we do because we chose not to use a well known franchised brand as a name.

 **What are the three things you love most about what you do?** 

Being able to provide clients with a positive experience where they’re often used to sub par management.  Working 24/7 has its drawbacks but oddly it’s one of the best parts of having a career in real estate. There is obviously some flexibility as well which I do value.

**Were you scared to take your first steps and what did you do to overcome that fear?** 

I think we all are but as long as we take those steps and just do what we feel is right everything tends to work out eventually.

**What advice can you give anyone who has a concept or idea but doesn’t know how or if they should pursue it?** 

Try it, at the very least just try it.

**How did you come up with the name of your business?** 

It basically embodies everything we try to stand for.  Sadly our industry still operates in the wild west so we try to change that and achieve some pretty amazing results in the process.

**Was there ever a time where you just wanted to throw in the towel and leave it all behind?** 

There are days, but I feel everyone has those no matter what it is that we do.

**Do you have any specific advice for others contemplating similar paths to yours?** 

Probably just take some time to ask some successful people in the industry about how they feel about it.  You never know what you’ll learn if you don’t ask.

**What’s the most amazing experience you’ve had that’s directly attributed to your career?** 

Seeing tears of joy in clients eyes.  It’s rare but it happens.

**Were you able to maintain a work life balance when you started out or did you have to make some fairly large compromises to gain traction?**  

Haha, let's just say I was working 24/7 for some time.  Thankfully I had a supportive group around me to keep me grounded.

**How can others contact you or where can they find you online for more information about your projects?**

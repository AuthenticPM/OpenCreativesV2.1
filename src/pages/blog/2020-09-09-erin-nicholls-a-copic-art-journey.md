**Tell us a brief bit about yourself and how you fell into your craft**

I'm a visual artist who specialises in [drawings using Copic markers](https://www.erinnicholls.com/). I mostly create street scenes of Japan, but sometimes I will branch out and do some hyperrealism or floral artworks. I've been working with Copics for 4 years now, after dabbling in oil painting on and off throughout my life. I've always been artistic and creative, so it was only a matter of time before I did something like this for a career.

**What did you wish you knew before you started your venture?**

I really just wish that I had started earlier in life. It's important for artists these days to know that social media plays a massive part in an artists' success. If you don't like marketing yourself, you may struggle. This has been a bit of an issue for me, but I'm able to do enough.

**Is there anything you wish you had done differently along the way?**

If I could go back, I would have started working with Copic markers sooner, and really pushed my instagram account a lot more. Perhaps YouTube as well. I think I would be much more successful right now if I had done those things.

**What are the most important failures you’ve had along the way?**

I took a break from doing artworks with markers and tried to do some abstract pieces in acrylics. I quickly realised this wasn't for me and it was a bit of a waste of time and money. I also had a group exhibition fall through, which put me off having exhibitions. So 4 years into my career and I still haven't had a proper exhibition. I have realised though that exhibitions aren't essential to an artists' success, but perhaps I would be more successful right now if I had gone down that path?

**What difficulties did you have to overcome early on?**

The main difficulties are mental and financial. Art supplies aren't cheap, and your income as an artist often isn't reliable or frequent. Mentally, you need to overcome doubts and push yourself to keep going.

**What are the three things you love most about what you do?**

I love that I can do it from anywhere in the world. I'm currently living in El Salvador after travelling for 3 months. I am also my own boss, which is something I always wanted. The best thing though is the sense of pride and achievement when I finish a piece. It's great being able to put my works on my walls and know that I created something I really like.

**Were you scared to take your first steps and what did you do to overcome that fear?**

I put it off for many, many years. What eventually pushed me to go for it was moving from Melbourne to Sydney, leaving my job as a Dental Technician behind, and realising that there was absolutely nothing else I wanted to do career-wise. So I essentially had to go for it, or be unhappy in some job that just paid the bills. What helped me initially was only working on my art part-time, so I wasn't relying on it to support me.

**What made you realise it was all starting to come together?**

When I started to get regular sales of both prints and original artworks, as well as winning the Bluethumb Art Prize in 2018 for my piece ["Smoke"](https://bluethumb.com.au/erinnicholls/Artwork/smoke-large-limited-edition-print-167790). It showed me that there are enough people out there who love my art that I am confident I can succeed as an artist.

**How did you come up with the name of your business?**

At first I contemplated using a business name, but couldn't really think of anything I was happy with. I then realized that most artists just use their own names, so I decided I would do that as well.

**Was there ever a time where you just wanted to throw in the towel and leave it all behind?**

I was recently struggling a bit with working on new pieces. I was getting bored with doing scenes of Japan, and tried some floral works for a while. I then started to doubt that decision, and even if I should keep using Copic markers. I then saw a photo of a street scene in Japan that I fell in love with and really wanted to create a drawing of. I messaged the photographer and he allowed me to use his photo as a reference. Doing that piece renewed my excitement for what I do, and I now have a commission for a Japanese street scene to do as well. This has helped me recognise where my passion lies.

**What motivates you on a daily basis to keep going and improving on what you do?**

I've put a lot of time and effort into building my career, it would be a shame to drop it now. There are times when I have my doubts about it, but then I will suddenly make a sale or get a commission and that spurs me to keep going. Also, I can't think of anything else I would do if I wasn't creating art!

**Do you have any specific advice for others contemplating similar paths to yours?**

If it is what you are passionate about, then go for it! You just need to recognise that there's no guarantee you will make any money from your art, and there are certainly a lot of artists out there, so make sure you are able to support yourself while producing works, and don't be afraid to make changes if you aren't succeeding.

**How long did it take you before you started to feel the hard work was beginning to pay off?**

It happened fairly quickly. Once I started drawing scenes of Japan I had my original artworks sell not long after I finished them, although at that time my prices were very low. It did give me a confidence boost though to keep going. Soon after I was able to gradually increase my prices.

**What’s the most amazing experience you’ve had that’s directly attributed to your career?**

I was a finalist in the Copic Award 2019 which was held in Tokyo, Japan. I was able to attend the award ceremony and my artwork was exhibited there for a week.

**Were you able to maintain a work life balance when you started out or did you have to make some fairly large compromises to gain traction?**

As an introvert it wasn't hard for me to spend a lot of time at home working. The main compromises I made were financial - I wasn't able to go out as much as I was suddenly earning a lot less, and didn't have a guaranteed income.

**How can others contact you or where can they find you online for more information about your projects?**

I have a website: [erinnicholls.com](http://erinnicholls.com/), or you can see progress photos of my work and contact me on my instagram: [https://www.​instagram.com/erinnicholls_​artist](https://www.instagram.com/erinnicholls_artist/)

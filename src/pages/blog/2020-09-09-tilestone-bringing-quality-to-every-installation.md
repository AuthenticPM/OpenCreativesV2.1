**Tell us a brief bit about yourself and how you fell into your career path**

I’m a 37 year old first generation immigrant from the middle east. We come from a family where hard work and striving to be best is in our DNA so as a young kid school holidays were spent on jobsites with my dad. That’s how I got interested in the construction industry. I set up my business at the age of 26 after working with the family since finishing year 12.

**Is there anything you wish you had done differently along the way?** 

Nope. All the mistakes teach you how to be better

**What are the most important failures you’ve had along the way?**

I’ve had some jobs that went bad because we missed a minor detail which taught me never to leave a client with a bad taste in their mouth. Basically it’s better to fix it even if it costs you triple because they appreciate it and the hit also teaches you not to do it again.

**What drives you to keep pushing forward?**

My biggest motivator is being able to provide for my family. It keeps me going and helps me to put all the difficult days into context so they don’t seem so bad.

**What difficulties did you have to overcome early on?**

Unlike some startups I didn’t have any capital behind me but I did have a lot of skills, knowledge and drive. The way things fell into place I started my business during the global financial crisis which wasn’t ideal but we’re still operating today so I’m thankful that I backed myself and pressed forward.

**What are the three things you love most about what you do?**

\- Being my own boss.

\- I thrive off the stress and pressure (weird I know)

\- Seeing the finished product

**Were you scared to take your first steps and what did you do to overcome that fear?**

Absolutely – I had a lot of negative thoughts about it at one point but I decided the best thing to do was to take a leap of faith and force myself to grow.

**What made you realise it was all starting to come together?**

The key point where I realised things were on track is where the work started to come rolling in on its own. Our reputation grew and we were able to leverage off the amazing work we carry out instead of marketing and things like that.

**Was there ever a time where you just wanted to throw in the towel and leave it all behind?**

Absolutely. I still have those days every now and then but the way I see it if I don’t have those days then I’m not doing something right because you’ll never have an easy run the entire time and you have to take the good with the bad.

**What advice can you give anyone who has a concept or idea but doesn’t know how or if they should pursue it?**

The only thing I can advise is if you’re not willing to put in your all and spend the majority of your time getting things off the ground (I’m talking working 60 hrs a week 7 days in the beginning) then don’t bother. That might sound harsh but it’s the reality of it, there are long hours and you have to make sacrifices for it to work because at the end of the day no one else is going to do it for you.

**How can others contact you or where can they find you online for more information about your projects?**

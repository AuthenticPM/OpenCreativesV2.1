After deciding to leave school in year 10 my parents advised that I must have an apprenticeship or I can't leave (great advice!). My older brother had just finished his electrical apprenticeship and it was something that I'd always enjoyed so I applied to approximately 40 different companies. I had two replies and got accepted into both.

**What are the most important failures you’ve had along the way?**

There has been many. I'm a big believer that if you don't fail you can't succeed. You definitely learn by your mistakes.

**What drives you to keep pushing forward and do you have a rally cry or motto that motivates you?**

Having a sporting background it has always been a mentality of knocking one brick wall down after another. What I mean by this is that there are always challenges and you just need to meet them head-on, face them and deal with them. The motto that I deal with now (and it's not great wording) is that at Glenco we have a “no Dick Head policy”. I know it's not great wording but what we are basically saying is we only want good people around as that is how you succeed.

**(Just for the record Brad we at Open Creatives do love the motto haha)**

**What difficulties did you have to overcome early on?**

Learning business and cash flow was probably the hardest one. Anyone could be an electrician (once you have a licence) but running a business and running it properly is completely separate.

**What are the three things you love most about what you do?**

Making clients happy. I know that is a cliché but the thrill you get at the end of the day when a client says to you you're amazing and thank you so much just never gets old.

**What made you realise it was all starting to come together?**

When your staff say that they love working here and don't want to leave. I am very lucky to have a fantastic staff that work here at Glenco. One of my staff members started 22 years ago when his son was four weeks old. He is still here now and his son has just become a qualified electrician. Love the fact that they are still here and they are just like family.

**Was there ever a time where you just wanted to throw in the towel and leave it all behind?**

There's always times when you think to yourself is it worth it. But I am also a big believer that there are going to be minor issues in anything you do in life. Nothing ever runs smoothly (obviously not wanting major issues) but it's how you deal with them and move on.

**What motivates you on a daily basis to keep going and improving on what you do?**

My staff. At the moment at Glenco we employ 70 people but that tells me that we feed hundred and 50+ mouths. Everyone has a husband, wife, partner and/or kids and they are all part of Glenco. It is important that we do well in the things we do as we are feeding everyone.

**Do you have any specific advice for others contemplating similar paths to yours?**

Don't die wondering. I was very lucky enough to play professional basketball and that was the one thing that was told to me when I started my career. It is basically telling me don't be afraid and have a go.

**What do you do to keep yourself mentally sharp and on the ball?**

I don't think I can put this down to anything in particular but I think it's pride. Getting up every morning and doing the best I can

**Thank you Brad, I can personally attest to the fine work your organisation does and cannot recommend you highly enough for your contribution to this project.**

**Tell us a brief bit about yourself and how you fell into your career path** 

I fell into this career path as soon as I left school, I use to go do a little market stand with my grandad every couple of months on my school holidays for university students! We always had fun being in a busy environment. Then while I was studying at Tafe I started working at a health food store called Dr Earth. I made all kinds of designs, ordered all the flowers and got to go to the markets. I love doing what I do, ever since I’ve started and I can’t wait to start my journey.



**What drives you to keep pushing forward and do you have a certain motto that motivates you?**

I love doing what I do which I feel helps me push forward! As they say if you love what you do you’ll never work a day in your life.

**What’s the most shocking thing you’ve come to learn while creating XO Flower House?**

I’ve learned a lot along my journey but one of the most shocking things I’ve learned is, even when you are as organised as can be doesn’t mean it’s always going to go to plan.



**What difficulties did you have to overcome early on?**

As I’ve only recently started this journey I haven’t had too many difficulties to overcome. One main problem has been stock flow since we have had the pandemic but we're keeping on top of things.



**What are the three things you love most about what you do?￼**

The three things I love most would be that I get to make gifts for people to help cheer them up.



I’m always surrounded by beautiful flowers and wonderful people.



I get to be creative every day, and that’s what I love doing :)

**What’s the most amazing experience you’ve had that’s directly attributed to your career?**

Completing wedding event flowers is the best feeling, as we get to meet a gorgeous bride and make her vision of a perfect day/event come to life. We also get to spend a heap of time planning and organising everything step by step - we draw up a plan/design, we're up at 4am to get everything organised, prep all the flowers/equipment for the event, load the van, then get to set up at each venue.

Seeing everything completed after all the hard effort is heartwarming. Then receiving feedback and photos from brides/bridesmaids makes you feel like you’ve completed something special.

**Were you scared to take your first steps and what did you do to overcome that fear?**

First steps are always hard as you hope everything falls into place. I’ve always wanted to have my own flower shop, so I’ve jumped into it knowing that it’s something I want and need to complete on my journey, and so far that has helped me get to where I am today.



**What advice can you give anyone who has a concept or idea but doesn’t know how or if they should pursue it?**

There is never a right time, so go with your gut feeling and do what is right for yourself. If you don’t try you’ll never know if you’ll pass or fail and that’s what we are here to do. Get into routine start off with baby steps and see if you are comfortable in that lifestyle.



**What made you realise it was all starting to come together?**

I started with baby steps, I was managing 2 stores for a health food store and I realised it was time for me to take the jump. I started up on social media like Instagram and Facebook. Then decided to design a website to have a main platform. After a couple of months went by I realised that If I want to keep growing I’ll need to expand my business into a shop!



**Are you working on anything exciting that you’d like to give us a sneak preview about?**

YES, our new store at Rozelle! We can’t wait to open. We will be selling lots of gifts from fresh flowers, everlasting flowers, candles, plants and MORE!



**How did you come up with the name of your business?￼**

We loved the name XO Flower House, as it is different from what I’ve seen around.



**Was there ever a time where you just wanted to throw in the towel and leave it all behind?**

Our journey is very NEW, so I haven’t felt that way and I’m hoping I never feel that way!

**What do you do to keep yourself mentally sharp and on the ball?￼**

Lots and lots of coffee! Haha.

Organisation is key, if you have everything planned out with back up plans. You’ll always come out on top!



**Were you able to maintain a work life balance when you started out or did you have to make some fairly large compromises to gain traction?**

Work life is all I need and want at the moment. We are a brand new business so I haven’t felt like I’ve had to push too many things away just yet. I’ve always still been able to make time for the little things I want to do.



**How can others contact you or where can they find you online for more information about your projects?**

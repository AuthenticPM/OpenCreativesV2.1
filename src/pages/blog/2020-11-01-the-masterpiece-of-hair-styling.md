**Tell us a brief bit about yourself and how you fell into your career path** 

So I was 14, and I got asked model for a hairdresser for a competition. so I did that. And from the experince I suppose the energy and the vibe from the competition and all the hairdressers and all the artistic side of things, sort of triggered me deciding that this is something that I could do.  And then I started working there on Saturdays and Thursday nights while I was at school. Yep. And then an apprenticeship came available. They are, I was in year nine. And there's like, and mom and dad wanted me to go to 12 and all that. And it's like, you know what, this is what I want to do. And from wasting my time at school, because this is what I want. So that's it. I left school and I started my apprenticeship.

**What did you wish you knew before you started your venture?**

But I think social socially is what it teaches you mainly, yeah. nd you know, like, at the end of the day, if there's something you want to do, you just go and do it. There's no point that you know, maybe I should do something else. But I just believe that, you know, whatever you do, if you do well you be successful. You know, there's something for everyone, you know, by me going to year 12 and getting a law degree, and we're doing a law degree or it doesn't mean that I'm going to be successful. It's what I'm going to want to play, someone else will replace myself.

**Is there anything you wish you had done differently along the way?**

Yeah, well, trusting people. Yeah.  It can be dificult at times.

**What are the most important failures you’ve had along the way?**

There's early days in my business, rush after a lot of times by staff and stuff. So it taught me a lot. Not to trust anyone. pick your staff very carefully.  The right people make all the differenece.

**What drives you to keep pushing forward and do you have a rally cry or motto that motivates you?**

Important failures. If there's anything you don't just say, next question, pause, whatever. Well, you know, it does come always comes back to trust. Yeah, trusting people. It is hqrd to trust when in a lot of cases because people don't show their true dolours until it's too late.  

**What difficulties did you have to overcome early on?**

Know, it does come always back to trust. Yeah, trusting people. Never trust people. Even your best friends as they can sometimew do things you wouldnt ecpect them to becase thet feel you owe them.

**What are the three things you love most about what you do?**

Well, I mean, obviously success, and, but most importantly, I have a family. So I need to support my family. So if I don't perform, then they miss out. And it's all about them getting me being able to give them as much as possible, you know, and if I don't push a lot of people that say that very same thing. Family is their main motivator because they want a better father.  Now go through school and need to be successful, I need to make money I need to bring them up and I want them to have a good life. So, you know, I do the best I can. So they might motivate more than anything, it's awesome. And obviously, so soft success, you know, mean? Like you want to be known to be good at what you do and you want reputation and stuff like that.

**Were you scared to take your first steps and what did you do to overcome that fear?**

I mean, there's always, you know, when I had my first business, which was a cafe, friend of mine came into the cafe and said to me, or, and I was 20 years old when I bought this business. And a friend of mine came in as experienced in having his own business and cafe industry. And he said to me, just a little word of warning every morning when you open up that door, you're gonna get a slap in the face. A smart man.  

**What advice can you give anyone who has a concept or idea but doesn’t know how or if they should pursue it?**

To worry about your own agenda. And you got to be a little bit selfish. Yeah. And I'm too generous in a lot of ways. And that's probably been my downfall because I trust people too much. And too soft, you know, and they take advantage of that trust.

**How did you come up with the name of your business?**

**C**ello was part of my surname, my surname Adoncello. Gotcha. Yeah. And my cousin

Was there ever a time where you just wanted to throw in the towel and leave it all behind?

**What motivates you on a daily basis to keep going and improving on what you do**?

That's the hobby or the life from now. Yeah. So if you know, if you want to provide a service, make sure it's the best service you can. And if you want to compete against other people, you need to have an edge on other people. You know, so like, if, for example, you know, the hairdresser down the road charges 20 bucks, but I charge 50. Why do I charge 50? Well, I provide a better service and that sells out in 10 minutes, I'll give you an hour of my time and make your cappuccino. I'll give you magazines we have conversations an get to know each other you know things like that at all. It all adds up so I can go to a barber shop and walk out of there in 15 minutes there pay 20 bucks, but I wasn't satisfied. I felt like I was just on a production line. And they the little differences you know, they really aren't that small and it's what bring joy and meaning to our lives.

**Do you have any specific advice for others contemplating similar paths to yours?**

All you've got to obviously look at what you are wanting to do now. And see where there's gaps in the market where you could introduce it.  And do your homework on costs, especially costs, on down costs, what you need to develop that it's going to be if you can do it on your own? Or if you need a team behind you. All those kind of considerations and, and money. Make sure you have a little bit of money.

**How long did it take you before you started to feel the hard work was beginning to pay off?**

My first salon. I borrowed money for I think it was about 50 grand. Yeah, but we only had five grand, that's been scary. Yeah. And you know, everyone I spoke to be an accountant or finance broker. But listen, that also, you should be able to cover your costs for the first year at least, you know,

**What’s the most amazing experience you’ve had that’s directly attributed to your career**

I did the same when we had the cafe we bought it without any money. But we just believe that if we gave it 100% was the breard man, it was a VR and, and start with small goals. You should be able to do it. I mean, if you're confident in what you do, you know, everything else follows. You know, I told my staff all the time, because now they're all on commission and stuff like that. It's like guys, it's not about how much money you make at the end of the week, or how much money you turn over. It's about making that client happy. Yeah, once that client walks out, they're happy and it makes all the difference

**What do you do to keep yourself mentally sharp and on the ball?**

**E**ducation, always keeping up to date with things always trying to improve? Yeah. Always keeping up to the minute with whatever's going on, especially in the industry, and also get involved with the hairdressing Association. So we sort of get to behind the scenes. So we sort of talk about things like, you know, how can we create? Or how can we get people to start in this industry because the industry is starting to die off regarding people coming in.

I think during Italy during that mash up, trying to obviously bring out the range of products from Italy was a great experience. I got to go to I got to perform on stage in Italy, monster world crowd for hairdressing. So that was really cool. And my experiences, they were amazing. I felt really, I felt worthy. Like I was doing all the right especially.

**Were you able to maintain a work life balance when you started out or did you have to make some fairly large compromises to gain traction?**

**I** always have to compromise a time you have to give it 100%. Even when you go home, when you finish work, you go home, you work on projects that you're going to do the next week or next year.

But it doesn't stop. My head's always spinning even now. That's unknown. That's me and our time. Yeah, my nighttime, let's see, that's why I don't get to sleep at night, because at night, I probably have a couple of wines. And then I start thinking too much. doesn't stop, there's no stopping. Try the family when I had the two salons when we initially opened. Because I had a great staff level and all that I managed to only work two days a week, which was good. I did one day here one day there. That was probably a time that was good, but and then I worked against me. Okay, because I wasn't there enough. And I gave opportunities to start the shop. So yeah,

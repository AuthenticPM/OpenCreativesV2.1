**Tell us a brief bit about yourself and how you fell into your career path**

My name is Sahmon and I run a family owned painting business. After finishing university I travelled and worked several jobs before joining my father and mother in running the family painting and decorating business that has now been running for 30 years.

**What did you wish you knew before you started your venture?**

I wish I knew how much spare time I had before owning my own business! Organising work, quotations, contacting clients and managing people eats up your waking hours so these are things to keep in mind when planning your own business.

**Is there anything you wish you had done differently along the way?**

I don't have too many regrets. I suppose the only thing I would have liked to have done is to have started working with Rosella Decorating earlier than I did. I feel like I would have a bit of a step up on my current skills had I jumped in earlier to help out.

**What are the most important failures youâ€™ve had along the way?**

I truly believe that making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn. Luckily I have not had any major failures that stick out for me but small day to day things that do not always go how I had planned are often the largest lessons that I take away from my job.

**What drives you to keep pushing forward and do you have a rally cry or motto that motivates you?**

It sounds cheesy but my main motivation is the satisfaction I get from helping people achieve something that they want. When people are happy with the final outcome I feel a sense of personal fulfilment and satisfaction.

**What difficulties did you have to overcome early on?**

My major obstacle has been adjusting to working longer hours than previous positions/ jobs I have held. Sacrificing weekends and holidays in order to keep up with the work load took me some time to come to grips with. Managing private/social/work life is tough particularly when starting a out on a new venture. Now I devote some of my weekend to keeping up with the business management side of my work while working longer hours some afternoons. I mitigate this by planning outings and short holidays in the future which give you something to work towards and look forward to.

**What are the three things you love most about what you do?**

I like being able to move around all day and be outside in the sun a lot of the time. Meeting friendly new clients and having interesting conversations gives me lots of enjoyment. The main one would be getting to work with the people that I work with. Most of them are first generation and it is a real pleasure to work with such fantastic people. We often swap stories and teach each other the other persons language.

**Were you scared to take your first steps and what did you do to overcome that fear?**

When my father went on holidays a few months after I began working with him full time, this was a scary thought! Looking down the barrel of one and a half months of running the business without any guidance was daunting to say the least. The only way I saw the entire period through was to trust and rely on my teams and put in extra effort whenever I could. By the end of this I managed to overcome many initial difficulties that I had once thought impossible.

**How can others contact you or where can they find you online for more information about your projects?**

I currently don't have any social media presence but am working on that. The best way to reach me is by giving me a call or text on 0408 677 265 or sending me an email at roselladecorating@live.com.au

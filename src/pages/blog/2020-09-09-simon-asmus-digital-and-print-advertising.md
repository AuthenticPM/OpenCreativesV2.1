**Tell us a brief bit about yourself and how you fell into your career path**

Hi, my name is Simon Asmus and I'm 41 years old, married for 16 years and have 2 daughters aged 13 years old and 9 years old. I began my first job at the age of 14 as a paper boy. I would work on a commission basis with a newsagency and I quickly realised the harder I blew my whistle and the quicker I covered my round the more papers I would sell. By the age of 18 when I finished high school I had 12 casual jobs in total and by the time I was 21 that number had increased to 17. In 2001 I started my first business at the age of 21. Over the next 8 years I built one of the largest toner cartridge businesses in Australia before selling in 2009 and going back to working at more places to gain experience in different fields. In 2011 I started another business which specialises in print media, letterbox distribution, magazines and online marketing. I rebranded it in 2014 and iCatching Media was born.

**How did you come up with the name of your business?**

I wanted a name where it stood out but explains what we do. I decided iCatching Media which is a play on the words ‘eye catching’ as most of our work is visual media.

**What did you wish you knew before you started your venture?**

If I was to pick one thing it would be to know the industry a bit more as I had never had a job within this specific space. Print is a far more technical industry than it seems.

**What are the most important failures you’ve had along the way?**

Over 20 years there has been so many failures in peoples eyes that I have seen as valuable business lessons. A few key ones are the importance of cashflow, how to have the right staff and business culture within the business, the importance of sales and marketing, understanding your target market and that you don’t need every client. Due diligence in all business dealings and transactions is important too.

**Is there anything you wish you had done differently along the way?**

The only thing I would have changed especially in the early days is to limit how many services we offered to our clients.

**What drives you to keep pushing forward and do you have a rally cry or motto that motivates you?**

Knowing that I am making a real difference to people's lives but also working with other business owners who are passionate about what they do. I love sales and marketing and for me I see business not as a job but a lifestyle. I can easily work 15 hour days, just like how I am doing this now at 11.23pm on a Saturday Night. You need to love what you do and trust the process... business isn't about getting rich quick, but instead it’s is a long game and patience I believe is the key to success and happiness with it.

**What do you do to keep yourself mentally sharp and on the ball?**

Self development. Having a belief in my ability and a clear road map of my goals. I usually set goals for every 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 5 years. The thing I also do is to set a few unrealistic goals with a goal to make that goal a reality. Think bigger than your thoughts of today and in 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 5 years you will be in a different headspace and have different skillsets if you push the limits.

**What advice can you give anyone who has a concept or idea but doesn’t know how or if they should pursue it?**

I get asked this quite a lot especially as I deal with many start up businesses. The best advice I give is to have an honest conversation with yourself and ask "why" you want to do it. In my experience most people start a business for financial freedom when they retire. In my opinion, you know if an idea is right if you constantly think about it, it keeps you up at night, and you have that burning desire to pursue the idea or concept. I would also suggest you be very careful who you get advice from. If you can find a mentor who has done something similar or understands the business that would help you make better decisions sooner. At the end of the day it is only an idea until you take action and implement the idea into reality.

**Do you have any specific advice for others contemplating similar paths to yours?**

My advice would be to learn as much as you can and understand the value of continuous learning. Try and look for opportunities by studying businesses and people. I find that I learn as much from peoples mistakes as much as their success as success usually leaves clues if you look close enough. The business life can be very lonely so try to become comfortable with being uncomfortable if that makes sense.

**Were you able to maintain a work-life balance when you started out or did you have to make some fairly large compromises to gain traction?**

I have a work/life balance that works for me. Yes, I still work long hours but I also allow quality time for family, friends and community. It is a balance and it needs to work for you. I don’t buy into the idea of the whole Monday to Friday 9 to 5.

**Are you working on anything exciting that you’d like to give us a sneak preview about?**

Yes, I’m currently working on a project that will transform how retail and trade service based businesses can advertise. I've also been working on another business that focuses on lead generation for trade services.

**How can others contact you or where can they find you online for more information about your projects?**
